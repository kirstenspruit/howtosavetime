      <span><mark>The feeling that <a href="https://spendingti.me/essaying/to-start/from-september-to-february.html">life is accelerating</a> is really the experience of <a href="https://spendingti.me/essaying/to-start/again.html">time whizzing without a direction</a>.</mark></span>
      </div>

    <div id="p3-the-right-time">
      <div class="window">
      <span><mark>The right time, or the right moment, only arises out of the temporal tension within a time that has a direction.</mark></span>

    <div id="p5-the-present-is">

    <div id="p5-the-tearing-away">
      <div class="window">
      <span><mark>The tearing away of time, the directionless acceleration of processes (which, because of the lack of direction, is no longer really an acceleration at all), is triggered by those point-like presences between which there is no longer any temporal attraction. Acceleration in the proper sense of the word presupposes a course which directs the flow.</mark></span>

    <div id="p7-the-counter-image">
      <div class="window">
      <span><mark>The counter-image to time fulfilled is time extended into an empty duration without beginning or end. Empty duration is not opposed to the tearing away of time; it is, rather, a neighbouring phenomenon. It is, so to speak, a silent form, or the negative, of accelerated doing; it is the time that would remain if there were nothing left to do or make, i.e. the temporal form of empty doing.</mark></span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="p8-empty-duration-is">
      <div class="window">
      <span><mark>Empty duration is a non-articulated, directionless time without any meaningful before or after, remembrance or expectation.</mark></span>

    <div id="p10-one-begins-ever">
      <div class="window">
      <span><mark>One begins ever anew; one zaps through 'life possibilities', precisely because of an inability to bring any single possibility to a conlusion. The individual's life is not informed by a story or meaningful totality. It is misleading to talk of an acceleration of life pursued with the aim of maximising its possibilities. Upon closer scrutiny, this acceleration turns out to be a nervous restlessness which makes life whizz, so to speak; it hurtles from one possibility to the next. It never achieves rest â€“ that is, completion.</mark></span>
