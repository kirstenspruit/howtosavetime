  INT. STUDIO SPACE - DAY.

  PROTAGONIST (28, blue jacket and socks) sits behind their desk and stares out the window.

  <h2>PROTAGONIST (V.O.)</h2><br>
  <h3>Where was I?<br><br>(pause)</h3><br><br>
  Protagonist starts typing on a MacBook.<br><br><br>
  <h2>PROTAGONIST (V.O.)<h2><br>
      <h3>I am not entirely sure where to start. It’s also not as if I’m only starting now; I have started many times, written many words. Still it feels like I am starting now.</h3>
      <br><br>
      Protagonist picks up a book – the cover reads The Scent of Time - Byung-Chul Han. They flick through the pages, in search of something.

        Protagonist watches the video. When it finishes a bunch of thumbnails pop up to form a grid with SP-404 sampler tutorials, vlogs of people quietly going about their morning routines in their minimalist homes, self-help
        videos on how to skyrocket your productivity and live purposefully, and "music for stress relief". Protagonist sighs. Antagonist rolls their eyes again.
